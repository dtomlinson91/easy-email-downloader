## Usage

To download emails from an IMAP server:

```python
from easy_email_downloader import EmailFilter, EmailConfig, download_emails

email_config = EmailConfig(
    host="mail.example.com",
    email_address="example@example.com",
    password="somepassword",
    mailbox="INBOX",
    port=993,
)

email_filter = EmailFilter(
    subject="daily report",  # subject filtering is server specific - full string matches often won't work
    sender="someone@gmail.com",
    messages_to_download=1,
    oldest_first=False,
    delete_after_download=False,  # be careful setting this to True - emails are permanently removed!
)

downloaded_emails = download_emails(
    email_config=email_config,
    email_filter=email_filter,
)

for downloaded_email in downloaded_emails:
    print(f"sender: {downloaded_email.sender}")
    print(f"date: {downloaded_email.date}")
    print(f"subject: {downloaded_email.subject}")
    print(f"content_type: {downloaded_email.content_type}")
    print(f"body: {downloaded_email.body[:50]}")
    print(f"attachments: {downloaded_email.attachments[:50]}")
```

Which produces:

```
sender: Daniel Tomlinson <dtomlinson@panaetius.co.uk>
date: Sat, 23 Apr 2022 20:55:31 +0100
subject: Download me using easy-email-sender
content_type: text/html
body: Successfully downloaded using easy-email-sender!
attachments: []
```

See below for more information on `EmailFilter`, `EmailConfig`, `download_emails` or see the docstrings.
### EmailConfig

Create your `EmailConfig` instance:

If you know the mailbox you want to download from:

```python
email_config = EmailConfig(
    host="mail.example.com", email_address="example@example.com", password="somepassword", mailbox="INBOX", port=993
)
```

If you don't know the mailbox to download from, use `EmailConfig.list_mailboxes`

```
email_config = EmailConfig(
    host="mail.example.com", email_address="example@example.com", password="somepassword", port=993
)
user_mailboxes = email_config.list_mailboxes()
```

This will return a list of strings of all the mailboxes in the user's account.

`EmailConfig` supports the following arguments:

```
Attributes:
    host (str): The host of the IMAP server.
    email_address (str): The email address to login as.
    password (str): The password.
    mailbox (str): The mailbox to download emails from.
    port (int): The IMAP port of the server.
```

### EmailFilter

Create an `EmailFilter` instance:

```python
email_filter = EmailFilter(
    subject="daily report",
    sender="someone@gmail.com",
    messages_to_download=1,
    oldest_first=False,
    delete_after_download=False,
)
```

`subject` and `sender` are optional. Either both, one or none of `subject` and `sender` can be set. If neither are
provided all emails in the mailbox will be searched for.

`EmailFilter` supports the following arguments:

```
Attributes:
    subject (str | None, optional): The subject to filter by. Defaults to None.
    sender (str | None, optional): The sender email address to filter by. Defaults to None.
    messages_to_download (int, optional): The number of emails to download. If -1 will download all. Defaults to -1.
    oldest_first (bool, optional): Whether to download emails starting with the oldest first. Defaults to False.
    delete_after_download (bool, optional): Whether to delete the emails after successfully downloading. Defaults to False.
```

üö® Be careful with `delete_after_download` - be sure you want to delete the email before you run it. This calls
`imaplib.IMAP4_SSL.expunge` which **permanently** deletes the email from the server.

### download_emails

Download emails using the `EmailConfig` and `EmailFilter`:

```python
downloaded_emails = download_emails(
    email_config=email_config,
    email_filter=email_filter,
)
```

This returns a list of `Email` objects.

The available attributes on an `Email` object are:

```
Attributes:
    sender (str): The sender in the form `first_name last_name <email_address>`.
    subject (str): The email subject.
    date (str): The date the email was sent.
    body (str): The content of the email. This is either in plaintext or as HTML.
    attachments (List[Optional[bytes]]): A list of attachments (if there are any) as bytes. If no attachments this
        is an empty list.
    content_type (str): The content type. Either `text/plain` or `text/html`.
```

Attachments are stored as a list of bytes. These can be saved to disk using `open("filename", "wb")` in the usual way.
