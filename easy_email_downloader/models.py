class EmailFilter:

    A dataclass used to store user options to filter emails on the IMAP server before downloading.

    `subject` and `sender` are optional and any combination of the two can be used. If both are left out then all
    emails are downloaded.

    Filtering emails by `subject` is implemented differently on each IMAP server. Exact strings often won't match.

    Care should be taken with `delete_after_download` - if set to True the email will be removed from the IMAP server.

    Attributes:
        subject (str | None, optional): The subject to filter by. Defaults to None.
        sender (str | None, optional): The sender email address to filter by. Defaults to None.
        messages_to_download (int, optional): The number of emails to download. If -1 will download all. Defaults to -1.
        oldest_first (bool, optional): Whether to download emails starting with the oldest first. Defaults to False.
        delete_after_download (bool, optional): Whether to delete the emails after successfully downloading. Defaults to False.
